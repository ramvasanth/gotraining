One of the most useful data structures in computer science is the hash table.
Many hash table implementations exist with varying properties,
 but in general they offer fast lookups, adds, and deletes.
 Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table.

 Declaration and initialization:

 map[KeyType]ValueType

 1. Map types are reference types, like pointers or slices
 2.A nil map behaves like an empty map when reading, but attempts to write to a nil map will cause a runtime panic
 3.The make function allocates and initializes a hash map data structure and returns a map value that points to it.
